                In this project, I interviewed the stylist Yana, made a short video about her and a small publication with interviews and photographs of things belonging to Yana. In the publication, I tried to show the love of my heroine for glossy magazines and newspapers: I made a layout like a newspaper layout and stylised photos.This project was about remaking an old book. I had to choose a book and take some of the features of this book in order to create remake based on the selected one. So, I chose the collection of poems “Five Thousand Favorite Lines” published by Young Guard.
